# swcat

`swcat` is a lightweight, file-based software catalog designed to help you maintain a clear and concise overview of the applications, services, and APIs within your team or organization.

It automatically generates SVG diagrams to visualize your software landscape, and allows you to explore your catalog through entity links and a powerful query language.

It is inspired by the [backstage.io](https://backstage.io/)
[Software Catalog](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/).
